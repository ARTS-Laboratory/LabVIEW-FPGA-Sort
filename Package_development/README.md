# Package_development
Development of code the sorting package. 

## Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v0
1. This is a bubble sort code originally developed for another project. 
1. v0.x are development code, just trying to get the old code up and running again.
1. Is indexed and can handle complex numbers. 
1. Generates a new zero-filled array and sorts into it. Is not memory efficient. 

## Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v1.0
1. Bubble sort.
1. This does not sort in-place.
1. Could work in a single cycle for loop, but not in SGL cycle. 

## Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v1.1
1. Set up as an array-based function. 
1. The Latch aspect did not seem to work. 
1. This is probably not the right way to sort complex numbers. 
1. This needs an increment 1 on the for loop stop, like that added in Bubble_sort_indexed_v1.0

## Bubble_sort_indexed_v1.0
1. This is a copy of Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v1.1. 
1. Dropping the (Complex) aspect of the code. 
1. This is a working code with a sub VI.
1. Currently only in SGL
1. Added an increment 1 on the for loop stop.

## Bubble_sort_v1.0
1. This is a copy of Bubble_sort_indexed_v1.0 with the indexing removed.
1. This is a working code with a sub VI.
1. Currently only in SGL
1. Added an increment 1 on the for loop stop.
