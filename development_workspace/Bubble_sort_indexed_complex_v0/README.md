# Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v0
	
## Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v0.1
1. This is a bubble sort
1. This is the original code developed in Fall 2020 that uses an iterative sort and provides an index. 
1. This code was written for a cRIO-9054.

## Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v0.2
1. Copy of v1
1. This code was written for a cRIO-9054, transfered to a cRIO-9035
1. This is missing a target code, not sure where it it is. 

## Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v0.3
1. Copy of the code "Latch" from Dropbox.
1. This is a This is a bubble sort with indexing and img numbers. 
1. This catches the first n points of an array. 

## Bubble_sort_indexed_complex_v0.4
1. Copy of v3
1. This code was written for a cRIO-9054, transfered to a cRIO-9035.
1. Not sure why the stop trigger is set to 8192. 
1. This sort does real and img components. 
1. This code compiles to the cRIO-9035 and runs just fine.
1. Cleaned up the non-FPGA code.
